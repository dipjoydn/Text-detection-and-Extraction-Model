Text-Detection-and-Extraction-Model

◦ Built an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system to automatically detect and extract textual content from images using computer vision techniques.

◦ Implemented image preprocessing pipelines including grayscale conversion, OTSU thresholding, and morphological operations to improve text visibility and OCR accuracy.

◦ Applied contour detection to localize text regions within images and performed region-wise text extraction for structured output.

◦ Integrated Tesseract OCR engine with Python to convert image-based text into machine-readable format and store extracted content in text files.

◦ Developed the solution in Google Colab with dynamic image uploads, enabling easy testing and reproducibility across different inputs.

Tech Used: Python, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, Pytesseract, Image Processing, Computer Vision
