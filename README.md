Text-Detection-and-Extraction-Model

◦ Developed an end-to-end data science pipeline to extract, preprocess, and analyze text from unstructured image data using OCR and NLP techniques.

◦ Implemented image preprocessing and contour-based text localization using OpenCV to improve OCR accuracy.

◦ Performed text cleaning, normalization, and exploratory text analysis to transform raw OCR output into structured datasets.

◦ Applied NLP techniques such as keyword extraction and text vectorization to identify patterns and insights from extracted text.

◦ Automated text extraction and analytics workflow to support downstream data analysis and reporting tasks.

Tech Used: Python, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR, Pandas, NumPy, NLP, Scikit-learn, Data Analysis
